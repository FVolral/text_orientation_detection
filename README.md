# Text Orientation Detection

Detect if an image that mainly contains text is arranged vertically or horizontally, not in which sens it should be rotated though. It's DIY and probably overfitted but seems robust. The idea use the excellent answer of Dhanushka Dangampola that can be found here :   https://stackoverflow.com/a/23672571/5075502. I try to detect text box and compute their ratio.
